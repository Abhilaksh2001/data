Problem Description:
You need to build a responsive grid of "Device cards for my MDM application" that:

Displays in a 6-column layout on large screens.

Switches to 4-column on medium screens (768px - 1024px).



Each card should:

Have a image that it is getting from the server url.

Display device name .

when clicked the card it should open a pop-up displaying details of the devices on the right side and on the left side it should open image of the device.

The whole component should be responsive.

The page can contain upto 1lakh devices so the UI must be in good performance.

We are getting device from external api
